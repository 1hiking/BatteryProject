# BatteryProject
A python learning project using Tkinter.
It's built with Windows in mind so I can't guarantee it will work on other Operating Systems, but it should in theory...


# Build

* Clone repository
* Run main.py

# Dependencies
* It requires `psutil` as a dependency
* It also requires `tkinter` but the later should come with Python by default...
